# EyeCare
EyeCare is an app for macOS which reminds you every 20 minutes to look at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

It allows you to customise the interval at which it reminds you. Set it to launch when you boot your Mac automatically, and you
can completely forget about touching it at all.

Written natively for macOS in Swift.

(I would love to write a Windows version too, please let me know in an issue if you would like this!)

## Digital Eye Strain

Being a computer nerd, I look at screens about 10 hours every day, and this rule, which has been recommended by optometrists, helps me
be able to get through the day. It is very important that everyone follows this rule, in order to avoid digital eye strain.
